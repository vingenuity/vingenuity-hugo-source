# vingenuity-hugo-source
This repository contains the Hugo source code for vingenuity.github.io. This separate repository is necessary because GitHub user sites require the site publish directory to be the root of master. See https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#host-github-user-or-organization-pages for more details.
