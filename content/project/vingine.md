Vingine is my custom C++ game engine that I worked on during my time at the SMU Guildhall.

<!--more-->

The goal of the Vingine project was to create a multiplatform game engine capable of handling both 2D and 3D gameplay. In the end, a 2D game was made fully functional across all of the listed platforms; however, no 3D games were created to test that functionality.
