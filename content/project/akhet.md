Akhet is a multiplayer first-person shooter that takes place in a sci-fi Egyptian world.

<!--more-->

Players take on the roles of avatars of the gods Ra and Anubis, who are fighting to gather the souls of the damned in order to return their gods to the mortal realm.

In order to revive their gods, players must gather the canopic jars containing the souls of the damned and return them to the altar of their god, where they will be absorbed into their gods' power.
